See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TTv4ibQAAAAJ).
Several papers are accepted or undergoing revision.


### undergraduate thesis

My [undergraduate thesis](/assets/pdf/ugrad_thesis.pdf) uses large scale network optimization models and algorithms, and was supervised by [Ozlem Ergun](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ergun-ozlem/).


### doctoral thesis

My [doctoral thesis](/assets/pdf/phd_thesis.pdf) on conic optimization formulations and algorithms was supervised by [Juan Pablo Vielma](https://juan-pablo-vielma.github.io/) and [Georgia Perakis](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/georgia-perakis). 
My [thesis defense slides](/assets/pdf/defense.pdf) give a partial overview.
