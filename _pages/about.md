_This academic site is new in May 2022 and still a bit bare-bones!_

I am an Australian citizen originally from sunny north Queensland. 

I did my BA at Harvard, concentrating in applied mathematics with a secondary in economics, and in 2013 I graduated summa cum laude with highest honors in field.
My undergraduate research/[thesis](assets/pdf/ugrad_thesis.pdf) focused on network optimization and large scale mixed integer linear optimization algorithms, advised by [Ozlem Ergun](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ergun-ozlem/).
I was a teaching fellow for three optimization courses at Harvard, including [Applied Math 121](https://am121.seas.harvard.edu/).

In May 2022, I finished my PhD at the MIT [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/). 
My doctoral research/[thesis](assets/pdf/phd_thesis.pdf) focused on conic formulations and algorithms for convex optimization, mixed-integer convex optimization, and nonconvex optimization, and I was advised by [Juan Pablo Vielma](https://juan-pablo-vielma.github.io/).
These methods are implemented in open source solvers (see [software](/chriscoey/software/)) written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and accessible through the optimization modeling language [JuMP](https://jump.dev/).
Since becoming involved with the JuMP-dev community in 2016, I have participated annually in the JuMP-dev workshops.
I was the teaching assistant for the graduate level course 15.083J (Spring 2018): _Integer programming and combinatorial optimization_.

I am continuing my research and software engineering projects as a postdoc / research scientist at the MIT [Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/).
